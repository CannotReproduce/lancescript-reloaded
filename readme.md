# It's back.  
LanceScript Reloaded is the official continuation of LanceScript. Expect performance improvements, bug fixes, new features, a clean-up of unused/broken/obsolete features, etc.

# What about LanceScript TEOF?  
I never ran that project nor had anything to do with it. While LanceScript has always had a focus on being open-source, TEOF was basically a redistribution that I didn't give them permission for. Because of it, a lot of confusion has been generated, and I have been at the shit end of the stick.  
Please do not confuse my work with unofficial continuations. I'm back now, so I will be the one maintaining this moving forward.  

## Install
Download the repo as zip and drag everything from it, except readme.md and license.txt, into your Stand's lua scripts folder. Done.  
Bug reports and suggestions should go into the Discord (there is a button in the script menu to access it).
